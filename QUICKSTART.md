### Web Interface (run_app.py)
```
🚂 Starting Railway Traffic Control System...
📁 Project root: /Users/supreme/railway_traffic_control
🐍 Python path includes: /Users/supreme/railway_traffic_control/src

🚂 Railway Traffic Control System
📍 Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
📊 Dashboard: http://127.0.0.1:5000/
🔧 API docs available at endpoints starting with /api/

Press Ctrl+C to stop the server
```

## 🎯 Demo Features

Once the web interface is running at http://127.0.0.1:5000, you can:

1. **View Current Trains**: See 6 sample trains with different types and priorities
2. **Run Optimization**: Click "⚡ Optimize" to see AI-powered recommendations  
3. **Try Simulation**: Click "🎯 Run Simulation" to test high-traffic scenarios
4. **Monitor Metrics**: View real-time performance statistics
5. **API Testing**: Try endpoints like http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/trains

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues Fixed:
- ✅ **Import errors**: Fixed with proper Python path setup
- ✅ **Template not found**: Templates moved to correct location
- ✅ **Module not found**: All relative imports converted to absolute
- ✅ **Flask startup issues**: Proper project root detection

### If You Still Have Issues:

1. **Dependencies**: Make sure all packages are installed
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Python Version**: Ensure Python 3.9+ is being used
   ```bash
   python3 --version  # Should be 3.9 or higher
   ```

3. **Working Directory**: Always run from the project root
   ```bash
   cd railway_traffic_control  # Must be in this directory
   ```

4. **Permissions**: Make sure scripts are executable
   ```bash
   chmod +x run_app.py run_tests.py launch.py
   ```

## 📊 Success Indicators

✅ **Tests Pass**: `run_tests.py` completes without errors  
✅ **Web Starts**: `run_app.py` shows "Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000"  
✅ **Dashboard Loads**: Browser shows the railway control interface  
✅ **API Works**: http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/trains returns JSON data  
✅ **Optimization Works**: Click "Optimize" button generates recommendations
