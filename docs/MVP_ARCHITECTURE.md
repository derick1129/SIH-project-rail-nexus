# Railway Traffic Control MVP - Architecture & Requirements

## MVP Scope and Features

### Core Features (Minimal Viable Product)
1. **Basic Train Scheduling**: Handle 5-10 trains on a simple linear section
2. **Priority-Based Conflict Resolution**: Express > Passenger > Freight priority system
3. **Simple Web Interface**: Display current status and recommendations
4. **Basic Performance Metrics**: Track delays, throughput, conflicts resolved

### Simplified Assumptions for MVP
- Single linear section with 3-5 track segments
- Pre-defined train schedules with known arrival/departure times
- Simple train types: Express, Passenger, Freight
- Basic safety constraints: minimum headway between trains
- No complex routing - trains follow fixed paths

## System Architecture

### Components
1. **Data Models** (`src/models/`)
   - Train class with priority, schedule, current position
   - Section class with track segments and capacity
   - Conflict class for tracking scheduling conflicts

2. **Optimization Engine** (`src/optimization/`)
   - Conflict detection algorithm
   - Priority-based resolution using linear programming
   - Simple scheduling optimizer

3. **Web Interface** (`src/interface/`)
   - Flask web application
   - Real-time status dashboard
   - Recommendation display for controllers

4. **Data Management** (`src/data/`)
   - Sample train schedules and configurations
   - Basic persistence for state tracking

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3.9+ with Flask
- **Optimization**: PuLP or OR-Tools for linear programming
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript with minimal framework
- **Database**: SQLite for simplicity
- **Visualization**: Chart.js for basic charts

## MVP User Stories

1. **As a Section Controller**, I want to see current train positions and schedules
2. **As a Section Controller**, I want to receive recommendations when conflicts occur
3. **As a Section Controller**, I want to see the impact of scheduling decisions
4. **As a Railway Manager**, I want to view performance metrics and KPIs

## Success Criteria for MVP
- Successfully resolve conflicts between 5-10 trains on a linear section
- Provide clear recommendations with reasoning
- Demonstrate 10-20% improvement in theoretical throughput vs random scheduling
- Web interface loads within 2 seconds and updates in real-time
- Handle basic disruption scenarios (train delays)

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- Multiple sections and complex network topology
- Real-time integration with existing railway systems
- Advanced ML algorithms for predictive scheduling
- Mobile interface for field controllers
- Integration with weather and maintenance data
